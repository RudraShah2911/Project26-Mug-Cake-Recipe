In a microwave-safe mug, mix all ingredients (except the chocolate hazelnut spread) until just combined.
Once combined, spoon the chocolate hazelnut spread on top of the batter.
Microwave on high for 90 seconds to 2 minutes, watching to make sure it doesnâ€™t spill over (depending on the size of the mug).
Let cool one minute before eating. Top with additional chocolate hazelnut spread and powdered sugar (optional).
Enjoy!
